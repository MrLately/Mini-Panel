pip3 install -r requirements.txt

put email on first line of credentials.txt
put password on the second line of credentials.txt

run server_control.py

at this point it only works with one server because
I only have one. If anyone would like to add that
ability feel free. I'd love to see it get better in
the wild.

enjoy!
